## Changelog
- v1.3: [BETA] Exporting/Importing Scope Presets: You can now share your scope presets with your team by exporting and importing them. Note that while this feature is in BETA, it should work well, though there might be some UI issues.
- v1.3: Migrated to webpack. Previously, it was a single JS file with almost 1000 lines. Now, it's separated into multiple files and then bundled into one file.
- v1.3: EvenBetter settings UI has been reworked.
- v1.2: Fixed some bugs
- v1.2: Added a new tab in Settings for EvenBetter plugin customization. Choose your Caido theme and enable/disable EvenBetter features.
- v1.12: http://ssrf.cvssadvisor.com/ integration! Type `$ssrfinstance` in Replay tab within the request body and it will automatically be replaced with the URL of your new SSRF instance! Also, a window with requests history to this instance will open up.
- v1.11: Sidebar state is now saved in the localStorage!
- v1.1: Implemented colors for HTTP History rows! If your HTTP request includes the parameter `_color=red`, its background will now be set to red. (it also supports other colors :D)
- v1.1: Resolved the Caido UI issue preventing scrolling in the Filters tab.
