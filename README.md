## PwnFox compatibility
With Caido version `0.32.0`, passive workflows were introduced, allowing us to integrate PwnFox support within Caido. Dynamic coloring has not been implemented yet which makes it harder to create workflow for PwnFox. With EvenBetter you can download the [PwnFox Support Workflow](https://github.com/bebiksior/EvenBetter/workflow/workflow-PwnFox_Support.json) and simply import it on the Workflow page!

## Share scope with your team
You can now share your scope presets with your team by exporting and importing them.


## ssrf.cvssadvisor.com integration
Type `$ssrfinstance` in the Replay tab within the request body and it will automatically be replaced with the URL of your new SSRF instance! Also, a window with requests history to this instance will open up (this doesn't work properly on MacOS yet).


## EvenBetter settings tab
Choose your Caido theme and enable/disable EvenBetter features.
